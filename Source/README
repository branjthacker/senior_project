PluginProcessor.h contains all of the global variable and functions
for the DSP.

PluginProcessor.cpp contains all of the DSP

PluginEditor files contain all of the code for the GUI.

To build this, you need to have JUCE downloaded and build it in Visual Studio 2022,
It took me a few hours to set up, so I reccomend looking at the demo video linked in
the report, which showcases the full functionality of the build.
If you really want to though... the first part of this video will walk you through it:
